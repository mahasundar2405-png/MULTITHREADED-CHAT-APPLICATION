This project is a multi-threaded client–server chat application developed using Java Sockets and Multithreading. The server handles multiple clients simultaneously by creating a separate thread for each connected client. Clients can send messages to the server, and the server broadcasts these messages to all connected clients in real time.
The application demonstrates network programming, socket communication, and concurrent thread handling in Java. It is suitable for understanding how real-time chat systems work and how multiple users can communicate efficiently through a centralized server.
